## Main Tests

- [T-Tests](/ttests.qmd)

## Unit 2

## TODO

- Assumptions of each test
	- [x] T-test
		- [x] Data is randomly selected from the population
			- Assume True
		- [x] Observations are independent from each other
			- Assume True
		- [x] Data is normal / sample size is large enough.
			- Shapiro-Wilk normality test
		- [x] Equal variance in response data
			- [x] `var.test` - H_o: Variance is equal
	- [ ] Chi-Square
		- [ ] No assumptions made about the data?
	- [ ] ANOVA/MANOVA
		- [ ] Each level's response variables are normally distributed
			- [ ] Shapiro-Wilk normality test
				- [ ] Null hypothesis - Data is normally distributed
		- [ ] Each level's response data has the same variance
			- LeveneTest
				- H_0 - Variance is equal
		- [ ] Samples must be independent from each other
			- Assume True
	- [ ] Post-hoc tests
		- [ ] TukeyHSD
			- [ ] Same as T-test/ANOVA
			- [ ] Data sets must be of equal length
	- [ ] Linear Regression
		- [ ] Linear relationship between variable
			- [ ] Plot data and look to see if the data is linear
		- [ ] There is constant variance of the errors (error are homescedastic)
			- [ ] `ncvTest` - H_0 - errors are homoscedastic
		- [ ] Error are statistically independent
			- [ ] Plot: x = fitted values, y = residuals (error), line y = 0
			- [ ] Look For patterns
		- [ ] Error are normally distributed
			- [ ] `qqPlot` - Points are within the bounded area.
				- [ ] What do the output numbers mean?
			- [ ] `shapiro.test(residuals)` - H_0 - Variance is equal
